Current State:
--------------
Camera movement not adjusted based on orientation of camera:
    -movement is strictly along X and Z axis of the world
Flashlight short ranged:
    -the fall off for the flashlight is too steep, must get close to objects to light them
Flashlight rotation too fast:
    -flashlight rotations are faster than camera rotations, unsyncs from camera when rotating
Layout is for iPad:
    -when running on anything that isn't an iPad, buttons aren't located in the correct locations
